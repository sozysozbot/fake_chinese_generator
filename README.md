# fake_chinese_generator

[main.html](https://sozysozbot.github.io/fake_chinese_generator/main.html) generates fake Chinese 
sentences with a very simple algorithm: generate Chinese characters solely based on 
the [Chinese character frequency list](https://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/char/list.php?Which=MO). 
Put the generated text into Google Translate, press the "listen" button, and you can instantly listen to what
hurts the brain of any native speakers of Chinese while being completely harmless to those who have no knowledge of the language.
